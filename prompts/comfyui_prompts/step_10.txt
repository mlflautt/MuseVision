Imagine a picture of two people standing in a field with the sun setting in the background. They are holding hands and smiling at each other. One of them has a tear rolling down their cheek as they look at the other, but both of them are still holding onto hope that they will be reunited soon. The field is full of flowers, and in the distance, a mountain range can be seen. The colors of the sky and the flowers are soft and warm, creating a sense of comfort and nostalgia.
