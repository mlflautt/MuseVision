Imagine a woman standing in a grand, opulent bedroom, bathed in the soft glow of flickering candles. She is dressed in elegant, flowing robes of silk and satin, with long, flowing hair that cascades down her back. She is lost in thought, her eyes gazing out at the palace courtyard where her beloved, Emperor Taizong, is riding on horseback towards the palace. She knows that their love is forbidden, but she cannot help but feel a sense of longing and desperation to be reunited with him.
