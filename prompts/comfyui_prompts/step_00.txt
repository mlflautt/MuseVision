Imagine a scene where Yang Guifei is sitting in her lavish bedroom, surrounded by opulent furniture and intricate decorations. She is dressed in elegant attire, with a flowing gown and a delicate veil covering her face. She gazes out of the window, looking wistful and longing for her lost love. In the background, you see a beautiful sunset, casting a warm golden glow over the room.
