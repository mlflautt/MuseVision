A picture of a family of four sitting on a couch, holding hands and smiling at each other. The parents are an older couple, and the two children are their teenage grandchildren. The room is filled with warm, cozy lighting and the sounds of laughter and conversation. Despite the distance between them, the family members are close and happy to be reunited after a long time apart.
